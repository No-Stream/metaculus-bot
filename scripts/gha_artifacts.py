"""Shared GHA-artifact enumeration + download core for the archive-sync scripts.

``download_research`` / ``download_run_logs`` / ``download_raw_research`` all do the
same six things: (1) enumerate EVERY repo artifact via the paginated REST endpoint,
(2) filter to an artifact family by name prefix, (3) report expired (unrecoverable)
artifacts loudly, (4) window by ``--since-days``, (5) dedup by originating
workflow-run id, and (6) make each unique artifact's contents available on local disk.
This module is the single implementation of that skeleton.

Two consumers use it:

* the three standalone scripts, each over its own family (research-* for the
  research archive; research-* + logs-* for the run-log + raw-research archives);
* ``scripts/sync_all.py``, which enumerates + downloads ONCE over the UNION family
  and runs all three harvests over the shared run dirs — so a ``make sync_all``
  does one download per artifact instead of three (one per standalone script).

THE PERSISTED ARTIFACT STORE
----------------------------
Downloads land in ``backtests/gha_artifact_store/<artifact-name>/`` and STAY THERE.
This is the fix for the original design, where every artifact was extracted into one
``tempfile.TemporaryDirectory`` that the generator wiped on close: harvesting had to
happen inside the iteration, and any ingest bug downstream destroyed the payload
rather than leaving it re-parseable on disk. GHA deletes artifacts at 90 days
(``maximum_allowed_days: 90`` for this repo — the ceiling cannot be raised), so the
staging area is transient by construction and local disk is the source of truth from
the moment an artifact is grabbed.

Each store dir holds the artifact's extracted contents plus a ``_meta.json``
(``artifact_id`` / ``name`` / ``created_at`` / ``run_id``) so an artifact's age is
knowable without another API call.

IDEMPOTENCY — SKIP-IF-PRESENT. An uploaded artifact is immutable, so a re-grab of one
already in the store is a no-op: ``ensure_store_current`` re-downloads only what is
absent or INCOMPLETE (a dir with no ``_meta.json``, i.e. a previous run interrupted
mid-extraction). Deleting a store dir is therefore the way to force a re-fetch.

The download path is READ-ONLY and FREE — it hits only the GitHub API, no LLM /
research calls, no publishing. ``from_store=True`` skips the API entirely and harvests
what is already on disk, so re-parsing after an ingest fix costs nothing and needs no
network.
