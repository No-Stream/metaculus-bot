"""Verify a candidate Gemini model id, and test the Google-Extended robots hypothesis.

This probe answers two questions the repo cannot answer offline, and it SPENDS the
operator's own Google AI Studio credit to do it, which is why it refuses to run
without ``--i-accept-spend``.

1. Does the candidate model id work on the native google-genai SDK, with grounding
   and with the ``thinking_level`` knob? A bad id fails as a 404 from the SDK rather
   than as a quiet fallback, so call 1 either prints a grounded answer with real
   search queries behind it or crashes naming the id.

2. Does Gemini's ``url_context`` tool honour a robots.txt ``Google-Extended:
   Disallow``? The hypothesis comes from prod: two internationalaisafetyreport.org
   URLs came back with zero retrievals while the answer text stayed fluent, which is
   the failure mode ``research/url_context_telemetry`` exists to catch — and that
   site disallows Google-Extended. Calls 2 and 3 read one URL each, matched on
   everything except that robots directive: Wikipedia allows Google-Extended, the AI
   Safety Report does not. If the allowed URL retrieves and the disallowed one does
   not, the directive is the mechanism, and no amount of retrying will fetch that
   host through url_context.

Run it locally, with GOOGLE_API_KEY set (the operator's personal AI Studio key —
there is no Metaculus-donated key on the google-genai side):
