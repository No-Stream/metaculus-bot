"""Question-supply probe over a tournament's post statuses, INCLUDING ``closed``.

Per slug it reports posts and questions at each status, the backlog of unresolved questions
past their own ``scheduled_resolve_time``, the FORFEIT sweep (closed or resolved questions the
bot never forecast, with their windows) and the miss rate per UTC release hour. Two platforms:
Metaculus (default; ``METACULUS_TOKEN`` required, ``my_forecasts`` fetched per post) and
Mantic's Crucible (``--platform mantic``; public reads, ``MANTIC_TOKEN`` optional, resolved
questions classified from the public spot-time snapshot). The platform seams are the
``PlatformProbe`` table in ``scripts/supply_probe_platforms.py``.

Read-only and free: only the platform's posts list and post detail, no LLM, research or publish
call. Paging stops on the first short page and every request carries a bounded 429 retry. Why
it exists, the API facts it is built around and how to read the report: ``docs/supply_probe.md``.

Usage:
    uv run python scripts/supply_probe.py
    uv run python scripts/supply_probe.py --slugs fall-futureeval-2026 --statuses open closed
    uv run python scripts/supply_probe.py --no-forfeits          # counts only, no detail GETs
    uv run python scripts/supply_probe.py --platform mantic     # public reads; MANTIC_TOKEN optional
    make supply_probe
    make supply_probe ARGS="--slugs metaculus-cup-fall-2026 --output /tmp/supply.json"
    make supply_probe_mantic ARGS="--slugs series-2 --output scratch/mantic_supply.json"

    One detail GET per post that needs one; the fetched payload replaces that post under EVERY
    status it was paged under, so two copies of a post that resolved mid-probe cannot disagree.
    Metaculus-only (``POSTS_URL``): Mantic's list page already answers, so it is never called there.

    ``slug`` only labels the log lines. The sweep spends minutes issuing spaced GETs and used
    to say nothing while it did, so a run that had wedged looked exactly like one that was
    working; it now reports progress every ``DETAIL_PROGRESS_EVERY`` posts, with one DEBUG
    line per GET for a per-URL trace.

    A post whose detail GET fails is left as it was, which reads through as ``unknown`` rather
    than as a forfeit: the sweep supplements the counts, and one unreachable post must not cost
    the slug its census. Raises nothing; an exhausted retry on EVERY post is a large ``unknown``.
