"""The shared ladder's entry point: what ``fetch_url`` binds onto the context, and rung 0.

``fetch_url`` is the one coroutine both cited-page fetchers call, so what it pairs is the whole
contract: the caller's :class:`LadderPolicy`, the aiohttp session and the process-wide per-host
politeness map. Each test here drives it end to end against a ``FakeSession`` rather than
patching ``_fetch_one``, because the thing worth pinning is that a knob set on the policy reaches
the rung that reads it, not that one function called another.

Lives in ``tests/resolution_source/`` for the package conftest's autouse DNS stub and its
process-wide gate resets; every hostname is an RFC-2606 reserved name with no real DNS.
