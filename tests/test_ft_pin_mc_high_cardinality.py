"""Pin test for the forecasting-tools 0.2.54 -> 0.2.92 upgrade: high-cardinality MC.

Companion to ``tests/test_ft_upgrade_seams.py`` and ``tests/test_ft_numeric_seams.py``
(FUTURE.md Workstream B). Revised 2026-07-23 for the installed 0.2.92; it defines
"done" for the multiple-choice clamp seam at the upgrade.

The seam: at 0.2.92 upstream's ``PredictedOptionList`` constructor drops its
``abs(sum - 1) < 0.0001`` early return and *unconditionally* clamps every option
into ``[0.01, 0.99]``, renormalizes, and raises ``ValueError`` when any option
moves more than ``0.05``. A high-cardinality ballot (>=6 options) with one
dominant option and several near-floor options is exactly where that raise
fires: the near-floor options each jump to ``0.01``, inflating the sum enough
that renormalization drags the dominant option down by >0.05.

The fix (W4): align ``MC_PROB_MIN``/``MC_PROB_MAX`` to ``[0.01, 0.99]`` and clamp
+ renormalize BEFORE every ``PredictedOptionList`` construction (drift-free, via
``clamp_and_renormalize_probs``), so upstream's constructor is a no-op and never
raises.

Two pins:

Pin 1 (``TestHighCardinalityMcSurvivesRealPipeline`` -- an INVARIANT PIN):
drives the *real* prod MC path -- ``extract_mc`` (deterministic block rung, no
parser-LLM call) -> per-model ``clamp_and_renormalize_mc`` -> ``MEDIAN`` combine
via ``aggregation_strategies`` -- on a 7-option dominant+near-floor ballot and
asserts the resulting ``PredictedOptionList`` respects OUR
``[MC_PROB_MIN, MC_PROB_MAX]`` clamp bounds, with the sub-0.01 near-floor options
floored exactly to ``MC_PROB_MIN``. This proves no raw/unclamped list reaches the
publish boundary; the pre-construction clamp keeps our values ahead of upstream's
stricter constructor.

Pin 2 (``TestRawSubFloorConstructionRaisesOn0292`` -- a DECISION PIN, resolved):
pins that a *raw* ``PredictedOptionList`` built directly from sub-floor (0.002)
options -- the dominant+eight-near-floor shape -- now RAISES ``ValueError`` on
0.2.92 (the 0.002 options clamp to 0.01, inflating the sum so renormalization
drags the 0.984 dominant down by ~0.059), and that our pipeline
(``build_mc_prediction``) clamps that same shape BEFORE construction so it stays
in bounds without raising.
