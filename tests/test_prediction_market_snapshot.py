"""The prediction-market pipeline end to end, through the seam's own `fetch_market_snapshot`.

The four stages wired together against a fake aiohttp session and both LLM stages stubbed: what
the pool sees, what the ranker's picks do to the render, every way the ranking can fail open, the
`as_of` leakage filter and its cache key, the raw-vs-stripped query split, and the ranking
telemetry line. The last class here pins the port's biggest silent-failure risk — that retrieval
width and the render cap are independent numbers.

Fakes, payload fixtures and the `handlers()` baseline live in `tests/market_retrieval_fakes.py`.

        prompt, and whether Manifold detail enrichment changes which rows get picked. Both then
        answer themselves from prod logs instead of another bake-off.

        wrong — keying on the title so two same-titled rows collide, or missing entirely and
