"""The `prediction_market_provider` factory — the research-provider entrypoint of the SEAM module.

What this file covers is the factory's own decisions: the two gates (`is_benchmarking`, the env
flag) and that neither flips the other's default, the deliberate `as_of=None` it passes, the
end-to-end fetch-and-format it hands the orchestrator, and the timeout-versus-stage-budget
arithmetic it warns about at init.

The rest of the seam's coverage lives in siblings, all of which share
`tests/market_retrieval_fakes.py` for the fake aiohttp session, the stubbed LLM stages and the
realistic venue payloads:

- `test_prediction_market_transport.py` — the shared bounded GET, and the catalogue cache/TTL.
- `test_prediction_market_llm_stages.py` — the two LLM stages' configs, budgets and concurrency.
- `test_prediction_market_snapshot.py` — the four-stage pipeline end to end, and its fail-opens.
- `test_prediction_market_formatter.py` — the formatter delegate and the liquidity labels.
- `test_prediction_market_diagnostics.py` — the seven per-source tokens, and provider health.

The retrieval machinery itself (venue parsers, pool assembly, the ranker prompt and parser, the
renderer) is unit-tested per module in `tests/test_market_retrieval_*.py`.

All HTTP is mocked via fake sessions and both LLM stages are patched, so nothing here opens a
socket or bills a key.
