"""Pool assembly: channel order, dedup, widths, degradation, and the enrichment hook.

Two of these tests exist because of specific ways the port could ship looking done while
measuring nothing:

- **The widths must actually be wide.** In the shipped provider the render cap doubles as the
  retrieval width (``top_k = max_matches_per_platform + 2``), so a ranked pipeline that
  inherited it would rank a 5-candidate pool. ``test_the_kalshi_channel_is_wide`` asserts the
  pool is far larger than the old caps against a catalogue that has the rows to fill it.
- **PredictIt's whole universe must reach the pool.** Its 197 markets come from one GET, so a
  width there would throw evidence away for nothing, and a re-added one would be invisible in
  every other test.

The remaining ones guard the ordering contract: channel order IS the ranking, and the pool's
head is the fail-open slate, so a channel that sorts differently or a dedup that keeps the
LAST occurrence silently changes what a degraded run publishes.
