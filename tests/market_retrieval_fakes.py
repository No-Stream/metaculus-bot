"""Shared fakes, payload fixtures and pipeline helpers for the prediction-market seam tests.

One canonical home for the fake aiohttp session, the two stubbed LLM stages, the realistic venue
payloads and the healthy-baseline handler dict. All of it used to live inside
`tests/test_prediction_market_provider.py`, which `tests/test_market_retrieval_venues.py` then
imported from — a test module serving as the fixture library for another.

Not named `test_*` on purpose: pytest must import this module without collecting it. A fixture
defined here is picked up by any test module that binds it in its own globals, and the consumers
bind them by ASSIGNMENT (`mock_question = _fakes.mock_question`) rather than by import: pyflakes
reads a same-named fixture parameter as an F811 redefinition of an import, which would otherwise
demand a per-signature suppression on every test that takes one.

All HTTP here is faked and both LLM stages are stubbed, so nothing in this module opens a socket
or bills a key.
