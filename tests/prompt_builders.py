"""Question stubs and prompt renderers shared by the ``tests/prompts/`` modules.

Every module in that package renders the same three base prompts over the same throwaway
question stubs, so the builders live here once. A plain module rather than a ``conftest.py``,
following ``tests/resolution_source_fakes.py``: none of these is a pytest fixture, nothing in
the prompt tests needs autouse setup, and an ordinary import is easier to follow than fixture
injection for a function that takes arguments.

Scope: these are the helpers used by MORE THAN ONE module. A one-off render stays inline in the
test that needs it, and the roughly twenty readable one-line ``binary_prompt(_binary_q(),
research="r")`` calls elsewhere are deliberately left as they are.
