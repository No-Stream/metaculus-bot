"""Pin the backtest question universe against the forecasting-tools 0.2.54 -> 0.2.92 upgrade.

Seam (FUTURE.md Workstream W5): ``question_prep._fetch_with_retries`` builds an
``ApiFilter`` for the resolved-question backtest fetch WITHOUT setting
``allowed_types`` — it relies on the upstream default. On 0.2.54 that default is
``["binary", "numeric", "multiple_choice", "date", "discrete"]``, which excludes
the conditional question type, so the backtest universe never contains
conditionals. At ft 0.2.92 the ``ApiFilter`` default is documented to admit
conditional questions (a new type) with a reshaped ``api_json['question']``. If
our filter keeps riding the default, the backtest universe silently widens to
include conditionals on upgrade — and the extraction path would then have to
deal with a type it was never built for.

``TestBacktestFilterExcludesConditionals`` drives the real filter construction
(the fetch itself mocked at ``MetaculusApi.get_questions_matching_filter`` so no
network runs) and captures the ``ApiFilter`` question_prep actually hands to the
fetch, then pins that its allowed types exclude conditionals. Green on 0.2.54
(default excludes conditionals); goes red at 0.2.92 (default admits them) until
W5 pins ``allowed_types`` to the supported set explicitly.

``TestGroundTruthExtractionRejectsUnsupportedTypes`` pins the second line of
defense: even if an unsupported type leaks past the filter, the ground-truth
extraction path drops it rather than passing it through.
