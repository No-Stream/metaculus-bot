"""End-to-end path for the time-series anchor: route -> fetch seam -> render -> bundle -> prompt.

Every other anchor test stops at one seam. `test_ts_routing` ends at the `_Route`,
`test_timeseries_anchor_provider` ends at the provider's return string, and the pipeline e2e
suites patch `run_research` wholesale, so nothing checked that a routed question's anchor
actually SURVIVES the research bundle and reaches the forecaster. Three links sit in that gap
and each is a live regression risk:

- the orchestrator has to select the provider off `TS_ANCHOR_ENABLED` and stamp the section
  with `provider_header("timeseries_anchor")`;
- that header string is `prompts.TS_ANCHOR_SECTION_HEADER`, and the numeric prompt gates its
  anchor-evidence clause on finding that exact substring in the research — so a header reword
  on either side silently drops the guidance while every unit test stays green;
- `_demote_inner_headings` runs over every provider body, so the anchor's own text has to come
  through it intact.

Only the network is mocked: `timeseries_anchor.fetch_series` is replaced with a synthetic
series (the module's real HTTP seam is covered in `test_ts_fetch`), the autouse egress guard in
`conftest` blocks anything else, and no LLM is reachable because the only enabled provider
makes no model call.

The 24/7 (crypto) shape is deliberate. It is the series whose horizon and volatility basis the
calendar-vs-row-count fix changed, and it is reachable in prod through any Yahoo ticker URL, so
the e2e assertion doubles as the pipeline-level receipt for that fix.
