"""The spend gates on the committed probe scripts are the only thing that makes them safe to keep.

Every credit spend in this repo goes through the operator (AGENTS.md, "Cost discipline"), so a
script anyone may run must be structurally incapable of spending. Two probes have a gate worth
pinning, one class each below.

`gemini_verify.py` is the one script whose whole purpose is to spend: three live calls on the
operator's personal Google AI Studio key, which is why it sits in the PAID list. Between a bare
`uv run python scripts/probes/gemini_verify.py` and those three billed calls there is exactly one
guard, the `--i-accept-spend` refusal, and it was asserted nowhere. So this module pins both halves:
the refusal must exit before the client is even constructed, and the accepted path must make three
calls and no more — a fourth call added later would spend more than the flag's own cost estimate,
and the operator's "go" was given against that estimate.

`fetch_diagnostic.py` is on the FREE list, but its column D runs the production escalation ladder,
whose one paid rung (the Gemini `url_context` read) is gated only on an env flag and a key that a
laptop mirroring prod supplies. `main` forces that flag off before any probe runs; the last class
here pins that the paid reader is never invoked even with the flag and a key set and the rung's
403 trigger population deliberately forced, so the free property is structural rather than a matter
of the environment.

Nothing here touches the network. The gemini client is replaced with a fake whose
`generate_content` returns real `google.genai` response objects, so `tests/conftest.py`'s autouse
`_block_network_egress` fixture has nothing to block and the shapes the probe reads
(`model_version`, `usage_metadata`, `grounding_metadata`, `url_context_metadata`) come from the
SDK's own models rather than from a hand-rolled stub that could drift from them. The fetch-diagnostic
class drives the real provider ladder against a fake refused session, so its 403 is produced by the
fetch layer rather than by the egress guard, whose `ssrf_blocked` status is not a url_context trigger
and would make the assertion pass vacuously.
