    That asymmetry had no reason behind it, and the import-time shape is the one that
    can bind to a loop which later dies.

    Scope note, so a reader doesn't over-trust this class: the failure an import-time
    ``asyncio.Lock`` can cause — "is bound to a different event loop" after a lock is
    left HELD at loop close — is real and reproducible in isolation, but NOT reachable
    through this gate. Driving the real ``_asknews_rate_gate`` that way, a second
    ``asyncio.run`` succeeds, because the cancellation releases the lock before the
    loop closes and a released lock rebinds cleanly. So these tests pin the lifecycle
    that was made consistent, and deliberately do not claim to reproduce a bug.
