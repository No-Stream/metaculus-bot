"""Direct unit tests for prompt-building functions in ``metaculus_bot.prompts``.

These exercise the prompt strings themselves (not the pipelines that call
them). Critical for the benchmarking carve-out: the higher-level gap-fill
tests mock ``_run_analyzer`` entirely, so without these the benchmarking
warning could be deleted from a prompt and no test would catch it —
backtest scores would silently get polluted with prediction-market data.
