"""Tests for the research-archive treatment tags (performance_analysis/research_tags.py).

The tags drive treated/untreated calibration cuts, so the load-bearing behaviors are:
depth-agnostic header detection (artifact ``##`` vs comment-backfill ``###``), the
diagnostics-corroborated confidence ladder on a False anchor read, the gfv2
section-vs-transcript distinction (the section is the treatment marker; the loop banks
a transcript even when it soft-fails), and all-None — never False — for a question
with no archive record.
