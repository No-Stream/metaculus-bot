"""Seam-pinning tests for the forecasting-tools numeric/MC data-model contracts
that the 0.2.54 -> 0.2.92 upgrade is known to touch (FUTURE.md Workstream B).

All tests are green on the currently-installed 0.2.54. They fall into two
kinds:

Pin 1 (``TestMcSubOnePercentProbabilityIsFloored`` — a DECISION PIN, RESOLVED
2026-07-23 at the 0.2.92 upgrade): the decision was to ADOPT upstream's 0.01 floor.
``MC_PROB_MIN`` moved 0.005 -> 0.01 and ``MC_PROB_MAX`` 0.995 -> 0.99 to match ft
0.2.92's ``PredictedOptionList`` validator, which dropped its ``abs(sum - 1) < 0.0001``
early return and unconditionally clamps every option into ``[0.01, 0.99]`` on
construction (raising on any >0.05 move). ``clamp_and_renormalize_mc`` now floors a
sub-0.01 option to ``MC_PROB_MIN``, so a 0.007 option is bumped to 0.01 through the
per-model clamp, the ``aggregation_strategies`` median combine, and the report publish
path. The pin below records that floored-at-0.01 behavior, replacing the old sub-0.01
semantics it was tagged to flag.

Pin 2 (``TestNumericDistributionAcceptsBeyondRangePercentiles`` — an INVARIANT
PIN): our numeric pipeline expresses out-of-bound probability mass by placing
declared percentiles beyond the displayed range (the Minions & Monsters /
Toy Story convention). This pins that upstream's plain ``NumericDistribution``
(a) constructs from that beyond-range ``sanitize_percentiles`` output without
raising, (b) does not rewrite ``declared_percentiles`` in its validators, and
(c) still exposes a ``.cdf`` that ``aggregate_numeric`` consumes to reproduce the
declared distribution. At 0.2.92 the strict validators (``_check_too_far_from_bounds``,
``_check_and_update_repeating_values``) can reject or mutate this convention;
the fix there is to thread ``strict_validation=False``. If any of these go red at
HEAD that thread is required, so the pin is the signal, not a silent break.
