"""Shared reader for the HTTP status forecasting-tools hides behind a re-raise.

ft's ``raise_for_status_with_additional_info`` re-raises a fresh, message-only
``requests.HTTPError`` (no ``response`` attached) and chains the original via
``raise ... from e``. Both MetaculusClient-patching modules — ``fetch_hardening``
and ``publish_hardening`` — need the real status to make their (deliberately
different) retry decisions, so the chain walk lives here ONCE; a correction to it
cannot land on one surface only.
