"""Post-hoc calibration of the bot's final published probabilities.

Implements logistic recalibration (Platt scaling) on the final binary and
multiple-choice outputs of the aggregation pipeline
(``metaculus_bot/aggregation_pipeline.py``). The hook is gated by
``PLATT_CALIBRATION_ENABLED`` and reads fitted parameters from ``params.py``.

Currently shipped with identity parameters by deliberate choice — see
``params.py`` for the rationale (in-sample benefit too small to justify
the cross-round parameter instability observed between fall-aib-2025 and
spring-aib-2026). The math, fit CLI, and integration hook are kept in
place so the analysis can be re-run cheaply when more data accumulates.

Numeric (CDF) recalibration is out of scope for this iteration and tracked
in ``scratch_docs_and_planning/FUTURE.md``.
