"""Recover one model's declared forecast value out of one reasoning body.

The three-rung extraction ladder, kept whole because the rungs only mean
anything as a sequence: the strict fenced-``json`` STRUCTURED FORECAST block
first, the historical prose value lines (``Probability: NN%``,
``Percentile X: V``, ``- Option: NN%``) second, and a tolerant raw-JSON salvage
of strict-invalid old-era blocks last. The percentile-label guard that runs
after every rung lives here too, since all three feed it. Split out of
``parsing`` so the ladder and its era-specific rationale sit together, away from
the attribution walk that decides WHOSE body is being read.
