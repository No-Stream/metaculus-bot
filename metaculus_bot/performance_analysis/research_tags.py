"""Research-archive treatment tags for performance records.

Reads ``backtests/research_archive/latest/<qid>.json`` and derives per-question treatment
flags (did the forecasters' bundle carry a Time Series Anchor section, an Agentic Research
Findings section from gap-fill v2) so calibration cuts can split treated from untreated
records without re-deriving the tags out-of-band each round. The residual rounds'
``anchor_tags.json`` is the reference output.

Every detection rule is source-class-aware, because the three archive writers head their
sections at different depths and only one of them can carry the ``gap_fill_v2`` payload.
Both gfv2 tags and ``anchor_confidence`` therefore read as TERNARY: None means the record
could not have recorded the fact, which is not the same as a measured False. The rules,
the confidence tokens and the receipt behind each are in ``docs/performance_analysis.md``
"Two treatment tags read as TERNARY".
