"""Comment text parsing and resolution parsing utilities.

Per-model attribution
---------------------
Metaculus bot comments contain two relevant sections:

1. A summary with ``*Forecaster N*: value`` bullets (one per ensemble member).
2. Rationales sections ``## R1: Forecaster N Reasoning`` whose first line is
   ``Model: openrouter/<provider>/<model>``, injected by
   ``main.TemplateForecaster._run_forecast_on`` when wrapping each prediction.

We key per-model results by the model display name pulled from the rationales'
``Model:`` line, not by the current ``FORECASTER_MODEL_NAMES`` list. This
avoids the failure mode where a roster change in ``llm_configs.py`` silently
relabels historical forecasts.

Stacked comments
----------------
When a question is stacked, the framework collapses all base predictions into a
single ``ReasonedPrediction`` — so there's only ONE ``## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning``
block, whose body contains both the stacker's meta-analysis and the base models'
reasonings folded in under a ``## Base Model Reasoning (inputs to stacker)`` sub-header.
See ``metaculus_bot.stacking.combine_stacker_and_base_reasoning`` for the exact
format. Per-base-model parsers below split on that delimiter to recover
attribution for each base model; the summary bullets only show the stacker's
aggregate, so per-base-model values are only recoverable from reasoning prose.

What lives here vs. next door
-----------------------------
The parsers every consumer calls stay in this module — ``parse_per_model_*``,
``parse_per_base_model_forecasts``, ``parse_resolution``, plus the shared
``MIN_SCOREABLE_ANCHORS`` floor and ``declared_anchors``. The mechanical layers
under them live next door and are re-exported here where an outside caller
already imports them from this path:

* ``performance_analysis.comment_sections`` — the summary/rationale boundary
  markers, the bullet + ``## R1:``/``Model:`` regexes, the stacker-combined body
  split, the positional ``Forecaster N`` keys, and the per-model block walk.
* ``performance_analysis.declared_value_recovery`` — the strict-block → prose →
  tolerant-salvage ladder for one reasoning body, and the percentile-label guard.
* ``performance_analysis.marker_readers`` — the ``STACKED`` / ``STACKER_OUTCOME``
  / ``STACKER_SKIP_REASON`` / ``FORECASTERS_USED`` trailer markers.
