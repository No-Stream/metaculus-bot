"""Bidirectional Metaculus post-id <-> question-id mapping for residual analysis.

Metaculus posts CONTAIN questions. A post has an ``id`` (the POST id, used in the
public URL ``/questions/<post_id>``) and its question has a SEPARATE ``id`` (the
QUESTION id). On older single-question posts the two coincide
(``post_id == question_id``) — which is why most questions show no divergence — but
on newer posts they differ (e.g. post 38880 wraps question 38195).

The bot's run-log telemetry markers are keyed INCONSISTENTLY across marker types:

* ``EXTRACTION_RUNG`` / ``OPEN_BOUND_PILING`` / ``CLOSE_MARGIN`` log
  ``question.id_of_question`` — the QUESTION id (38195 in the example above).
* ``GAP_FILL_V2`` / ``GHOST_FORECAST`` / ``GHOST_FORECAST_JSON`` log
  ``question.page_url`` — a POST id (38880).

A residual grep that filters on ONE id therefore silently drops the records keyed
on the OTHER. And because both ids live in the SAME integer namespace and collide
across questions (one question's post id can equal a *different* question's
question id), a blind "match either id" is unsafe — it admits cross-question false
matches. The two safe primitives are:

1. an EXPLICIT mapping, built at pull time from the performance dataset — the only
   source that carries BOTH ids per question side by side (the collector emits
   ``post_id`` and ``question_id`` on every record); and
2. SELF-DESCRIBING telemetry records: each marker record carries ``qid_kind``
   (``"post_id"`` | ``"question_id"``) naming which space its ``qid`` lives in
   (emitted by :func:`scripts.telemetry.markers._build_record`).

With both, a lookup TRANSLATES the query into the record's own id space instead of
guessing. This module is that mapping plus the telemetry-filter helper that
respects ``qid_kind``.
