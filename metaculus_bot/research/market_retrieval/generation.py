"""Pool assembly: three retrieval channels unioned into one ranked candidate list.

**Channel order IS the ranking.** ``add()`` keeps first-seen position, so a structural
settlement-source hit always precedes a venue-index hit, which always precedes a fuzzy fill,
with no cross-channel score comparison anywhere — which matters because the scores are not
comparable (1.0 for a structural hit, an inverted venue rank, a 0-100 fuzzy score). That
ordering is used for two things and they must stay the same one: the order candidates are
PRESENTED to the ranker in, and the deterministic fail-open slate. Presenting in the
fail-open order is what makes a fail-open a truncation of what the model was shown rather
than a different pipeline.

WITHIN a channel every venue's rows carry that channel's own ordering signal, so each is sorted
by it before the width can cut: ``fuzzy_best`` for the settlement join, the venue's inverted
rank for venue search, ``fuzzy_best_many`` for the Kalshi universe, dump order for PredictIt
(which has no width). No channel is compared against another.

The design is recall-maximal on purpose. The bake-off measured that **selection, not
generation, is the binding constraint**: a perfect ranker over this pool reaches 14/16
questions while the deterministic top-4 of the same pool scores 5/16. So nothing here filters on
RELEVANCE — there is no score floor, and the retired ``KALSHI_MIN_FUZZY_SCORE`` /
``PREDICTIT_MIN_FUZZY_SCORE`` floors are absent rather than defaulted, because a floor is
what discarded the adjacent-cut markets that carry most of the evidential value. The one
exception is ELIGIBILITY: an explicit ``as_of`` drops a candidate that already closed, which is
leakage defence rather than a relevance judgment, and it happens inside ``add()`` so the width
still means "N eligible candidates" (as a post-hoc filter it deleted rows the width had already
spent its slots on).

Everything CPU-bound runs in ONE ``asyncio.to_thread`` hop, and that is not hygiene:
``publish_hardening.py`` documents how a pinned event loop misattributes forecaster
soft-deadline drops to the forecasters. Building the settlement-domain index belongs in the
same hop — it walks the same ~10k events and is not memoized.

The hop only works because the scan itself releases the GIL. As a per-event Python loop the
full-catalogue fuzzy scan measured ~0.45-0.59s of GIL-HOLDING bytecode (9,762 events x ~17
queries), so the offload bought nothing — it converted one freeze into sustained starvation,
with loop lag p50 at 15-20ms single-question and 56ms at 6 concurrent. Batched through
``fuzzy_best_many`` (``rapidfuzz.process.cdist``, which threads internally) the same work is
~0.06s and the loop returns to idle. The settlement index walk and the catalogue sort are still
real CPU, which is why the hop stays; row CONSTRUCTION is not, since the universe channel yields
lazily and only the rows inside the width are ever built.
