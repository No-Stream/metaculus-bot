"""The two fetch markers' one spelling, for both callers of the shared ladder.

``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_FETCH`` and ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_ESCALATION`` are data contracts: the research
archive matches them by regex on the exact field order and spelling
(``scripts/telemetry/markers.py``). Two callers now emit them — the resolution-source fetcher at its
per-question aggregation point, and the gap-fill v2 loop after each tool call — so the format string
lives here rather than once per emitter, where the two would drift a field apart and the archive
would silently stop parsing one of them.

Each caller still owns its own ``logger``, so a line keeps the module prefix of the code that
produced it, and its own ``question=`` ref: the fetcher has the question id at that point and the
loop does not (its three event markers carry ``question=None`` for the same reason, so a join to a
question goes through the run id). Field semantics and receipts:
``docs/telemetry_markers.md``.
