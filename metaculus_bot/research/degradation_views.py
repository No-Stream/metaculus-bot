"""The orchestrator's read-only views onto the research side's module-global counters.

Split out of ``orchestrator.py``: none of this touches orchestrator state or the
research phase at all. The prediction-market and provider-health counters are module
globals (they have to be — the providers soft-fail internally, deep inside fan-outs
the orchestrator never sees), and these views are how they reach the forecaster's
``alertable_count`` and the end-of-run summary. Grouping them keeps five pass-throughs
and their long "why is this alertable" rationales out of the live orchestration path.

``ResearchOrchestrator`` mixes in ``ResearchDegradationViews``, so every consumer
(``forecaster.py``, ``cli.py``, ``degradation_counters.py``) keeps reaching them as
attributes of the orchestrator.

``provider_health`` is imported at module scope and read through the module at call
time, which both keeps the cheap import off the function bodies and preserves the
patch surface tests use (``monkeypatch.setattr(provider_health, ...)``).
``prediction_market`` stays behind function-level imports: it pulls the optional
market stack (rapidfuzz, aiohttp), which has no business loading for a run that never
enables the provider.

        venue produced (``market_field_contract``), or a prefetch reporting success
        while returning an empty catalogue (``catalogue_empty``). Each is a
        100%-of-denominator conjunction over the whole run, so a single question
        with no matching market stays silent — the denominators are a venue's own
        pool rows and a catalogue's own size, never questions-in-a-run (prod runs
        carry 1-2 questions, so a rate over those IS a per-question flag).

        The first is the signal that would have caught Kalshi's liquidity labels
        blank on 100% of rows for weeks in prod while every counter read zero; the
        second closes its blind spot, since a catalogue that silently empties out
        looks to it like a venue with nothing to say. A third rule (Signal B, a
        venue contributing nothing while >=2 siblings answered) was deleted
