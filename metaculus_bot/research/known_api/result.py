"""The neutral result every known-API backend returns, and the two adapters read.

One shape for a FRED series, a Yahoo history, a market snapshot or an EDGAR filing, so the
adapter to the gap-fill loop's ``ToolOutcome`` and the adapter to the resolution-source
fetcher's ``FetchResult`` each read one thing. The ``status`` token stays inside the existing
``ok`` / ``empty`` / ``not_found`` / ``error`` family the fetch vocabulary already uses, so
neither adapter invents a new status. Detail: docs/research.md "Known-API registry".

A backend NEVER raises to its caller: an unknown id is ``not_found`` with the provider's
message, an empty window is ``empty``, a transport or quota failure is ``error`` naming the
exception class.
