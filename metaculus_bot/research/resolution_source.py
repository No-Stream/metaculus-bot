"""The resolution-source provider: an adapter over the shared fetch ladder.

Reads the pages a question names as its own grading source, so every forecaster sees the ground
truth the question will be scored against. ``select_fetchable_urls`` picks the cited URLs worth a
fetch, ``fetch_resolution_sources`` fans one task per URL out to ``fetch_ladder.ladder.fetch_url``
under ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_POLICY`` with one shared aiohttp session, the process-wide per-host
politeness map and one per-question rung budget, and ``resolution_presentation`` renders the result.
A page embedding a Datawrapper chart earns one more phase here, the dataset hop, since trafilatura drops it.

Two hard gates, both in the factory. ``is_benchmarking=True`` returns ``""``, because a page read
today post-dates any backtest window, the same leakage guard the prediction-market provider carries.
And ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_ENABLED`` must be truthy.

Every fetch runs inside one ``asyncio.wait_for`` on ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_WALL_TIMEOUT``, which throws
away every page that already fetched when it fires. That is why each rung bounds itself against the
same clock, and why ``fast_path``, the question's thin-window mode, rides every context to make the
two expensive rungs decline rather than drop this cheap, hard-capped provider.

Telemetry is emitted here, at the per-question aggregation point, because that is where the question
id exists: one ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_FETCH`` line per fetched URL, one ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_ESCALATION``
line per rung that fired, the per-rung counts, and the results into the research archive.

``strip_markdown_escapes``, ``looks_like_csv_rows`` and ``format_resolution_sections`` are re-exported
here under ``noqa: F401`` for the Tier-1 suite, which imports them from this module path; none of the
three moved in the ladder extraction, so the re-export cannot go stale.

The fetch, its rungs, the body classification and the outbound guard live in ``research/fetch_ladder/``,
documented in ``docs/architecture.md``, "The shared fetch ladder" and ``docs/research.md``,
"Resolution-source fetcher".

    the live datasets of any Datawrapper charts the fetched pages embed.

    ``query`` is the question's title plus resolution criteria. It never touches the
    network; its one job is ranking which passages of a cited PDF a forecaster sees.
    Empty is legitimate (a caller with no question text in hand) and simply means a
    document renders its header and outline with no passages. ``fast_path`` is the
    question's time-budget thin-window mode; it rides every URL's :class:`LadderContext`
    and makes the two expensive rungs decline (see there).

    Distinct hosts run concurrently up to the connector limit; same-host
    requests serialize (politeness — e.g. StatCan asks Crawl-delay: 2). The
    host-semaphore map is now the PROCESS-WIDE one
    (:func:`http_fetch.host_semaphores`, scoped to the running loop) rather than a
    fresh dict per call: with one map per call, six questions fetching the same host
    concurrently each held their own semaphore and hit it six times at once. Every
    ``ladder.fetch_url`` task shares it, so each hop contends on ITS host's semaphore —
    chains from different initial hosts that converge on one final host still
    serialize there; the Tier-2 dataset fetches contend on the dwcdn host's semaphore
    the same way. Session is closed in ``finally``.

    Sharing the map buys that politeness at the cost of CROSS-QUESTION serialization: a
    same-host queue now forms across the concurrent questions, inside a
    ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_WALL_TIMEOUT`` that was not raised and that discards work which
    already succeeded when it fires, so a question that loses the queue can lose every
    page it had already fetched rather than just the contended one (reproduced; the
    archived tail says 3 of 23 all-fail fetches ran the full per-request timeout). The
    acquire wait itself is deliberately unbounded — see FUTURE.md item 5, where both
    remedies (partial harvest, or a budget-bounded wait) are the operator's call.

    Teardown race guard (F5): the outer factory wraps this call in
    ``asyncio.wait_for``. When the wall-clock timeout fires, wait_for cancels
    this coroutine — but if a gather is still in flight we'd exit the
    ``async with session`` block while children are mid-request, and aiohttp
    would then close their transports out from under them (surfacing as
    scary tracebacks in logs, and in extreme cases resource-warning fires
    on connections that never got cleaned up). We use explicit Task objects
    — pages and datasets alike — so we can cancel + drain them in a
    ``finally`` before the session closes.

def _log_fetch_outcome_markers(qid: int | None, results: list[FetchResult]) -> None:
    """Emit ONE greppable ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_FETCH`` line per fetched URL.

    Per-URL outcomes used to live only in free-text log lines and in the published
    comment's provider-diagnostics block, so a cut like "cdc.gov is 0 successes in
    1,069 fetch records" meant re-scraping run logs that expire from GHA at 90
    days. This is the harvested form (spec ``resolution_source_fetch``,
    ``scripts/telemetry/markers.py``); the free-text outcome lines it replaces were
    deleted rather than kept beside it, so no fetch is logged twice.

    Emitted here, at the per-question aggregation point, because that is where the
    question id exists — threading it down through ``fetch_resolution_sources`` /
    ``ladder._fetch_one`` / the ladder's classification helpers would change the signature
    of the whole monkeypatched fetch surface to carry a value only a log line reads.

    Tier-2 dataset hops ride the same marker and are identified by their url, which
    is always ``static.dwcdn.net/data/<chart_id>.csv`` — that host is reachable no
    other way, so a query can partition cited pages from hop artifacts on it.
    ``status`` is the shared token (``ok`` for a success, else the verbatim
    ``FetchStatus``) and ``embeds`` names the routeless data-embed providers found in
    the page's raw HTML, which is what makes an unreadable-embed page queryable even
    when its prose made it a success.

    ``reason`` is appended only where the status alone is ambiguous —
    ``no_resolving_content``'s ``embed_shell`` vs ``thin_page`` vs the
    ``no_matching_passage`` of a document read in full that discusses nothing the question
    asks about vs the paid reader's ``not_addressed``, ``unreadable_document``'s
    ``no_text_layer`` vs ``encrypted`` vs
    ``malformed``, and the ``budget_skipped`` / ``parse_contention`` that say an
    ``unsupported_type`` was a document we were holding.
    ``route`` is appended only when a ladder rung produced the outcome. Both are
    appended rather than always emitted so every line the archive already holds stays
    byte-identical and an absent field keeps meaning "this does not apply", not "old
    record"; both sit at the tail in the order the marker spec's optional groups do.

    Each rung that FIRED also gets one ``RESOLUTION_SOURCE_ESCALATION`` line. The
    fetch line above carries only the final outcome, so on its own it cannot say
    whether a rung rescued the page or what the attempt cost — and ``wall_s`` is what
    decides whether a rung earns its latency under a close-derived time budget. Both
    ``outcome`` and ``wall_s`` are the RUNG's own (``RungAttempt``): the status that stood
    once that rung was over and what that rung alone cost, so on a page where a dead feed
    GET was followed by a rescuing render the first line reads the direct status and the
    second reads ``success``, and neither is billed for the other's latency. The ``url``
    on an escalation line is the URL the rung was invoked ON, which for a meta-refresh hop
    is the stub rather than the target the fetch line names, and for a ``route=rendered``
    rescue is the cited URL while the fetch line names the URL the browser landed on (since
    2026-09-04; before that boundary the two agreed, so a per-URL join against the cited URL
    is exact only for earlier records and otherwise keys on the escalation line).
