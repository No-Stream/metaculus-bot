"""Per-provider research-observability primitives.

A ``ProviderResult`` captures, for one research provider's call, what the
orchestrator's ``_run_one`` chokepoint already sees: outcome status, output
size, wall-clock latency, and any exception detail. The orchestrator persists
these to the durable research artifact (schema v2) and renders them into a
compact, pipe-delimited block that is logged at INFO, archived, and appended to
the published Metaculus comment — but deliberately kept OUT of the
forecaster-facing research text (the diagnostics seam in
``ResearchOrchestrator.run_research`` / ``TemplateForecaster``), so
failures/empties/timing survive beyond the ephemeral GHA run-log without
distracting the forecasters.
