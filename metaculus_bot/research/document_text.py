"""Deterministic PDF text extraction and lexical passage selection.

Stdlib and pypdf only, with no I/O of its own: bytes in, structured text out. Both
consumers — the Tier-1 resolution-source fetcher, which drops every PDF unread, and the
gap-fill v2 research loop, which sends every PDF to a paid Gemini ``url_context`` read —
already hold the bytes by the time they need the text, so acquiring them is the caller's
job and keeping this module free of network and model calls is what lets either one use
it without inheriting the other's dependencies.

Why deterministic extraction comes first: measured 2026-09-03, local pypdf pulled 833,450
chars out of a 6.7 MB 220-page PDF in 5.3 s and the passage the driver was looking for was
in it, while the paid reader returned nothing for the same file. So the order is acquire
the text locally, select the relevant passages locally, and spend a model call only on a
document we genuinely cannot read (``unreadable_reason``, or an empty
``has_text_layer``, which together separate "we could not parse this" from "this is a scan
with no text layer at all").

``is_pdf_body`` re-implements the ``%PDF-`` half of the private ``_body_is_document`` in
``research/agentic/fetch_outcomes.py`` rather than importing it: this module is the shared
foundation the agentic loop calls, so an import in that direction would invert the
dependency. The one-line magic check is cheaper to duplicate than the inversion is to live
with, and the two are pinned against each other in ``tests/test_document_text.py``.

Extraction is CPU-bound (pypdf parses and decodes every content stream), so an async
caller must run ``extract_pdf_text`` in a thread — ``asyncio.to_thread`` — never inline on
the event loop.

# body-size limit caps the COMPRESSED bytes, max_pages does not help when one page carries the
# whole stream, and max_seconds is only checked between pages (see _read_pages), so the one
# bound that reaches inside a single page is pypdf's own decoded-output cap, which its
