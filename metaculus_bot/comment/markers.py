"""Shared constants + regex for the stacker-outcome HTML-comment markers.

Keeping the literals + regex in one module avoids silent producer/consumer drift
if either side changes the comment shape, so this docstring is where the meaning
of every marker value lives and the code below carries at most a one-line
pointer. The markers are injected into each published Metaculus comment by the
bot's ``_create_unified_explanation`` override (see ``main.py``) and parsed back
out by the residual-analysis collector via
``metaculus_bot.performance_analysis.parsing.parse_stacked_marker``.

STACKER_OUTCOME
---------------

``STACKER_OUTCOME=<primary|fallback_llm|fallback_median|fallback_mean|skipped|skipped_config_off>``
is the tri-state-plus marker, and it replaces the lossy ``STACKED=true/false``
marker, which silently mislabeled a median fallback as ``STACKED=true`` and could
not express the conditional-stacking skip path at all.

* ``primary`` and ``fallback_llm`` mean a stacker LLM produced the value.
* ``fallback_median`` means no stacker LLM did (both failed, or
  CONDITIONAL_STACKING's wall-clock budget skipped them) and the members were
  combined under that strategy's MEDIAN rule.
* ``fallback_mean`` is the same outcome on the regular STACKING budget-skip path,
  whose base combine is MEAN (F15). STACKING's budget-skip path base-combines by
  MEAN where CONDITIONAL_STACKING's does so by MEDIAN, and the original
  ``fallback_median`` marker mislabeled it, so the separate value is what makes
  the rule that ran readable from the published record.
* ``skipped`` means the conditional-stacking trigger short-circuited the stacker
  because spread stayed at/below the threshold.
* ``skipped_config_off`` means spread EXCEEDED the threshold but the per-type
  ``<TYPE>_STACKING_ENABLED`` env gate was off, so the stacker was deliberately
  bypassed: config-suppressed rather than spread-suppressed. (2026-07 residual
  round: 22 numeric "skipped" suppressions had to be re-attributed to config-off
  via git archaeology — this value makes the reason durable in the published
  record.) Comments published before this value shipped collapse both skip
  reasons into ``skipped``; disambiguating those requires the workflow-yaml flag
  history.

On a binary or MC question the outcome names the rule that ran. On a numeric or
date question it names only the STRATEGY's rule, and the rule that ran is the
run-log ``NUMERIC_AGGREGATE ... method=`` field
(``metaculus_bot/member_forecast.py``), which is authoritative: a question
elicited per bin (``numeric.config.elicit_per_bin``, a Mantic grid of
``PMF_ELICITATION_MAX_BINS`` bins or fewer) is pooled by the pointwise MEAN
under every outcome, ``fallback_median`` and the two skips included, and a
percentile question under a MEAN-strategy run carries ``method=mean`` with no
stacker outcome at all.

``STACKER_OUTCOME_RE`` lists ``skipped_config_off`` ahead of ``skipped`` in the
alternation so the longer literal wins on first match rather than relying on
backtracking after the ``skipped`` branch fails the trailing ``-->``. The
import-time asserts at the bottom of this module pin that ordering (the full
literal must be captured, not just its ``skipped`` prefix) along with every other
literal/regex pair, so an edit that breaks the invariant fails at import rather
than silently weeks later when the collector runs against real comments.

STACKED (legacy)
----------------

``STACKED=<true|false>`` is the legacy binary marker, derived from the new
outcome (true ↔ outcome ∈ {primary, fallback_llm}, false ↔ outcome ∈ {skipped,
skipped_config_off, fallback_median, fallback_mean}). Both families coexist on
every stacked comment for one round of back-compat so external parsers don't
break the day this fix lands; new analyses should prefer the STACKER_OUTCOME
variant. ``STACKED_MARKER_RE`` tolerates surrounding whitespace and casing so
accidental reformatting of already-published comments (e.g. a markdown editor
normalizing whitespace) doesn't silently desync the collector.

STACKER_SKIP_REASON
-------------------

An additive companion to STACKER_OUTCOME, emitted only on the skip paths. The
outcome value ``skipped`` conflates two mechanisms — spread at/below threshold,
and the single-forecaster short-circuit that never computes a spread at all
(q44870, the first resolved instance, is indistinguishable from a low-spread skip
in the outcome alone) — so the reason gets its own marker rather than a new
outcome value: STACKER_OUTCOME stays byte-stable for every existing parser of the
legacy value. ``config_off`` restates skipped_config_off's reason so the field is
self-contained. ``spread_undefined`` is the fifth and rarest: the spread could
not be MEASURED at all (a non-positive normalizing denominator — see
spread_metrics' SPREAD_UNDEFINED WARN), so the routing decision rests on no
measurement. It must not read as ``spread_below_threshold``, which is an
affirmative "the models agreed".

TOOLS_USED
----------

The probabilistic-tools activation marker, emitted alongside STACKED by
``_create_unified_explanation`` so residual analysis can distinguish
tool-augmented runs from vanilla stacking runs.

FORECASTERS_USED
----------------

The ensemble-size disclosure marker, injected into every published comment by
``build_unified_explanation``. It records how many forecasters CONTRIBUTED (== the
number of ``*Forecaster N*`` summary bullets) out of how many were CONFIGURED
this run. Without it a comment carrying two bullets is ambiguous between a
3-model ensemble where one model never answered (a drop) and a genuine 2-model
era (a roster change) — CLAUDE.md's "fewer than N bullets" gotcha. It rides the
preserved comment tail alongside the STACKER_OUTCOME markers, so it survives the
150k middle-trim. Cause of any drop stays in the run-log FORECASTER_DROPS
telemetry (operational detail), not the public comment.

Stacker section headers
-----------------------

``STACKER_META_ANALYSIS_HEADER`` and ``STACKED_BASE_REASONING_HEADER`` are
emitted by ``metaculus_bot.stacking.combine_stacker_and_base_reasoning`` inside
the single R1 body for stacked questions, and shared with
``metaculus_bot.performance_analysis.parsing``, which splits the body on
``STACKED_BASE_REASONING_HEADER`` to recover per-base-model attribution.

``BASE_MODEL_SUBBLOCK_SPLIT_RE`` splits the base-model portion of a
stacker-combined R1 body into per-model sub-blocks, one per
``Model: openrouter/<provider>/<name>`` line the bot injects ahead of each base
reasoning. Two consumers share it so they can never drift:
``metaculus_bot.performance_analysis.parsing`` reads it to recover
per-base-model attribution, and ``metaculus_bot.comment.trimming`` uses the same
split so a length-trim shrinks each base sub-block from within — keeping every
base model paired with its own ``Model:`` line and JSON forecast block. The value
is required to contain ``/`` so a narrative line like ``Model: previous version``
inside a base reasoning's prose can't be mistaken for a sub-block boundary: the
bot-injected prefix is always a slash-delimited OpenRouter path (e.g.
``Model: openrouter/openai/gpt-5.5``).

Historical stacker signature
----------------------------

``HISTORICAL_STACKER_META_HEADER`` and ``HISTORICAL_STACKER_SIGNATURE_RE``
recover stacked comments published before the explicit ``STACKED=`` /
``STACKER_OUTCOME=`` markers existed. Three header variants are in the wild (all
stacker-only): ``## Stacker Meta-Analysis`` (current), ``## Meta-Analysis``
(older), and ``# Meta-Analysis and Synthesis`` (earliest H1). Match condition:
the meta header is the FIRST heading after ``## R1: Forecaster 1 Reasoning``
(modulo a possible ``Model:`` line). A bare ``## Meta-Analysis`` deeper in a body
isn't signal — that pattern shows up inside individual non-stacker forecaster
reasoning bodies too.
